<span style="color: whitesmoke; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Now go to sleep in chasms deep with darkness all around you,
Though rock and dread may be your bed, so sleep my baby dear,
Now comes the storm but you'll be warm, the wind will rock your basket,
The crystals fine will glow sublime, so sleep my baby dear ,
And with a song it won't be long, you'll sleep my baby dear. </span>
